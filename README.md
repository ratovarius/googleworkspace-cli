`gws` doesn't ship a static list of commands. It reads Google's own [Discovery Service](https://developers.google.com/discovery) at runtime and builds its entire command surface dynamically. When Google Workspace adds an API endpoint or method, `gws` picks it up automatically.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is under active development. Expect breaking changes as we march toward v1.0.

## Prerequisites

- **Stable Rust and Cargo** — to build this fork from source
- **Python 3.10+** — for the optional Docs review and export companions (POSIX systems)
- **A Google Cloud project** — required for OAuth credentials. You can create one via the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) or with the [`gcloud` CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) or with the `gws auth setup` command.
- **A Google account** with access to Google Workspace

## Installation

Install the maintained fork's `main` from source:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/ratovarius/googleworkspace-cli --branch main --locked google-workspace-cli
```

To use the Docs review companions as well, keep a source checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ratovarius/googleworkspace-cli.git
cd googleworkspace-cli
cargo build --workspace --locked
export PATH="$PWD/target/debug:$PATH"
```

See [Docs review](examples/docs-review/README.md) and
[visual review bundles](examples/docs-review-bundle/README.md) for their commands.
Check `command -v gws` to confirm which installed binary your shell will use.

This initial fork publication provides source on GitHub. The upstream
`@googleworkspace/cli` npm package, `google-workspace-cli` crates.io package,
Homebrew package, and [upstream releases](https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli/releases)
install the original distribution and do not include fork-only improvements.
For a reproducible source build, replace `--branch main` with `--rev COMMIT_SHA`
using the fork commit you have reviewed.

## Quick Start

```bash
gws auth setup     # walks you through Google Cloud project config
gws auth login     # subsequent OAuth login
gws drive files list --params '{"pageSize": 5}'
```

## Why gws?

**For humans** — stop writing `curl` calls against REST docs. `gws` gives you `--help` on every resource, `--dry-run` to preview requests, and auto‑pagination.

**For AI agents** — every response is structured JSON. Pair it with the included agent skills and your LLM can manage Workspace without custom tooling.

```bash
# List the 10 most recent files
gws drive files list --params '{"pageSize": 10}'

# Create a spreadsheet
gws sheets spreadsheets create --json '{"properties": {"title": "Q1 Budget"}}'

# Send a Chat message
gws chat spaces messages create \
  --params '{"parent": "spaces/xyz"}' \
  --json '{"text": "Deploy complete."}' \
  --dry-run

# Introspect any method's request/response schema
gws schema drive.files.list

# Stream paginated results as NDJSON
gws drive files list --params '{"pageSize": 100}' --page-all | jq -r '.files[].name'
```

Discovery-generated API commands and `gws docs +write` support credential-free
`--dry-run`: they validate inputs and display the request without obtaining a
token, accessing the keyring, reading or changing stored credentials, or sending
the API request.

```bash
# Preview a Docs append without signing in
gws docs +write --document DOC_ID --text 'Hello, world!' --dry-run
```

These previews work offline with a fresh cached Discovery schema (24-hour TTL).
First use or an expired cache can still fetch the schema over the network.
Other helpers may need authenticated reads to prepare their plans; this guarantee
applies to raw API commands and `docs +write`.

### Fields absent from Discovery

Raw API methods with a request body accept `--allow-unknown-fields` alongside
`--json`. Use it explicitly when an API supports fields that its public Discovery
document does not yet describe. It allows unknown properties recursively,
including nested objects and array elements, and forwards their values unchanged.
JSON is still parsed and serialized normally; whitespace and key order may change.

Validation remains strict by default. With the flag, known-field types, enums and
required fields are still checked, as are JSON syntax, required URL parameters and
file paths. It does not allow new enum values on a known field. The flag is local
to raw methods and does not apply to handwritten `+` helpers.

For example, Docs suggestions and comments require a Cloud project enrolled in the
[Google Workspace Developer Preview Program](https://developers.google.com/workspace/preview).
Google still enforces API availability, OAuth scopes, document permissions and
server-side validation. This flag grants no additional access.

```bash
# Preview a suggested insertion (Docs Developer Preview).
gws docs documents batchUpdate \
  --params '{"documentId":"DOCUMENT_ID"}' \
  --json '{"requests":[{"insertText":{"location":{"index":1},"text":"Suggested text"}}],"writeControl":{"writeMode":"SUGGEST"}}' \
  --allow-unknown-fields --dry-run

# Preview a comment anchored to existing text; adjust the range for your document.
gws docs documents batchUpdate \
  --params '{"documentId":"DOCUMENT_ID"}' \
  --json '{"requests":[{"insertComment":{"content":"Please review this text.","range":{"startIndex":1,"endIndex":5}}}]}' \
  --allow-unknown-fields --dry-run
```

`--dry-run` uses the same validation policy and shows the request without sending
it. It cannot verify preview enrollment or server acceptance. Remove `--dry-run`
to submit a request. See the Docs
[request reference](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/reference/rest/v1/documents/request#InsertCommentRequest)
for preview field requirements.


## Authentication

The CLI supports multiple auth workflows so it works on your laptop, in CI, and on a server.

### Which setup should I use?

| I have… | Use |
|---|---|
| `gcloud` installed and authenticated | [`gws auth setup`](#interactive-local-desktop) (fastest) |
| A GCP project but no `gcloud` | [Manual OAuth setup](#manual-oauth-setup-google-cloud-console) |
| An existing OAuth access token | [`GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_TOKEN`](#pre-obtained-access-token) |
| Existing Credentials | [`GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CREDENTIALS_FILE`](#service-account-server-to-server) |

### Interactive (local desktop)

Credentials are encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM) with the key stored in your OS keyring (or `~/.config/gws/.encryption_key` when `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_KEYRING_BACKEND=file`).

```bash
gws auth setup       # one-time: creates a Cloud project, enables APIs, logs you in
gws auth login       # subsequent scope selection and login
```

> `gws auth setup` requires the [`gcloud` CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install). If you don't have `gcloud`, use the [manual setup](#manual-oauth-setup-google-cloud-console) below instead.

> [!WARNING]
> **Scope limits in testing mode:** If your OAuth app is unverified (testing mode),
> Google limits consent to ~25 scopes. The `recommended` scope preset includes 85+
> scopes and **will fail** for unverified apps (especially for `@gmail.com` accounts).
> Choose individual services instead to filter the scope picker:
> ```bash
> gws auth login -s drive,gmail,sheets
> ```


### Manual OAuth setup (Google Cloud Console)

Use this when `gws auth setup` cannot automate project/client creation, or when you want explicit control.

1. Open Google Cloud Console in the target project:
   - OAuth consent screen: `https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=<PROJECT_ID>`
   - Credentials: `https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=<PROJECT_ID>`
2. Configure OAuth branding/audience if prompted:
   - App type: **External** (testing mode is fine)
3. Add your account under **Test users**
4. Create an OAuth client:
   - Type: **Desktop app**
5. Download the client JSON and save it to:
   - `~/.config/gws/client_secret.json`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **You must add yourself as a test user.** In the OAuth consent screen, click
> **Test users → Add users** and enter your Google account email. Without this,
> login will fail with a generic "Access blocked" error.

Then run:

```bash
gws auth login
```

### Browser-assisted auth (human or agent)

You can complete OAuth either manually or with browser automation.

- **Human flow**: run `gws auth login`, open the printed URL, approve scopes.
- **Agent-assisted flow**: the agent opens the URL, selects account, handles consent prompts, and returns control once the localhost callback succeeds.

If consent shows **"Google hasn't verified this app"** (testing mode), click **Continue**.
If scope checkboxes appear, select required scopes (or **Select all**) before continuing.

### Headless / CI (export flow)

1. Complete interactive auth on a machine with a browser.
2. Export credentials:
   ```bash
   gws auth export --unmasked > credentials.json
   ```
3. On the headless machine:
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/path/to/credentials.json
   gws drive files list   # just works
   ```

### Service Account (server-to-server)

Point to your key file; no login needed.

```bash
export GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/path/to/service-account.json
gws drive files list
```

### Pre-obtained Access Token

Useful when another tool (e.g. `gcloud`) already mints tokens for your environment.

```bash
export GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_TOKEN=$(gcloud auth print-access-token)
```

### Precedence

| Priority | Source                 | Set via                                 |
| -------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Access token           | `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_TOKEN`            |
| 2        | Credentials file       | `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CREDENTIALS_FILE` |
| 3        | Encrypted credentials  | `gws auth login`                        |
| 4        | Plaintext credentials  | `~/.config/gws/credentials.json`        |

Environment variables can also live in a `.env` file.

### Troubleshooting saved credentials

If `gws` cannot read or decrypt `credentials.enc` (including a keyring access
failure), it returns an authentication error and preserves that file,
`token_cache.json`, and `sa_token_cache.json`. It does not silently switch to
plaintext credentials or Application Default Credentials (ADC). This applies to
the default configuration directory and `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CONFIG_DIR`.

Check that you are using the original configuration directory and can access its
original OS keyring or encryption key. Back up the configuration before changing
key storage or replacing credentials. Preservation does not recover a lost key.
If you intentionally want to discard saved credentials and sign in again, use
`gws auth logout` followed by `gws auth login`; logout still removes saved
credentials and token caches.

An explicit `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_TOKEN` or
`GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CREDENTIALS_FILE` still takes precedence. A missing or invalid
explicit credentials file is an error. When no encrypted credentials file exists,
the usual plaintext and ADC fallback remains available.

## AI Agent Skills

The repo ships 100+ Agent Skills (`SKILL.md` files) — one for every supported API, plus higher-level helpers for common workflows and 50 curated recipes for Gmail, Drive, Docs, Calendar, and Sheets. See the full [Skills Index](docs/skills.md) for the complete list.

```bash
# Install all skills at once
npx skills add https://github.com/ratovarius/googleworkspace-cli

# Or pick only what you need
npx skills add https://github.com/ratovarius/googleworkspace-cli/tree/main/skills/gws-drive
npx skills add https://github.com/ratovarius/googleworkspace-cli/tree/main/skills/gws-gmail
```

<details>
<summary>OpenClaw setup</summary>

```bash
# Symlink all skills (stays in sync with repo)
ln -s $(pwd)/skills/gws-* ~/.openclaw/skills/

# Or copy specific skills
cp -r skills/gws-drive skills/gws-gmail ~/.openclaw/skills/
```

Install this fork using the source instructions above before using agent skills. An agent installer that uses the upstream npm package will install the original distribution.

</details>

## Gemini CLI Extension

1. Authenticate the CLI first:

   ```bash
   gws auth setup
   ```

2. Install the extension into the Gemini CLI:
   ```bash
   gemini extensions install https://github.com/ratovarius/googleworkspace-cli
   ```

Installing this extension gives your Gemini CLI agent direct access to all `gws` commands and Google Workspace agent skills. Because `gws` handles its own authentication securely, you simply need to authenticate your terminal once prior to using the agent, and the extension will automatically inherit your credentials.

## Advanced Usage

### Multipart Uploads

```bash
gws drive files create --json '{"name": "report.pdf"}' --upload ./report.pdf
```

### Output and upload file roots

`--output` and `--upload` accept paths within the current working directory
(CWD) by default, including absolute paths that resolve inside CWD. To allow
files elsewhere, set a trusted operator environment variable to an existing
directory:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/gws-files
export GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_FILE_ROOT=/tmp/gws-files
gws drive files get --params '{"fileId":"FILE_ID","alt":"media"}' \
  --output /tmp/gws-files/report.pdf
gws drive files create --json '{"name":"report.pdf"}' \
  --upload /tmp/gws-files/report.pdf
```

The root replaces the allowed file boundary; relative CLI paths still resolve
from CWD. For example, `--output report.pdf` is rejected if CWD is outside the
configured root. The root is canonicalized and must exist as a directory; an
empty or invalid value fails validation. Relative root settings resolve from
CWD too. With an explicit root, CLI paths containing `..` components are
rejected. Control characters and symlinks escaping the boundary are rejected;
symlinks resolving inside it are allowed, but dangling symlinks are rejected.
These CLI file flags require a UTF-8 canonical path. If a symlink resolves to a
path with unsupported encoding, the command returns a validation error rather
than dropping the upload or selecting the default output file.

This setting affects only these file flags, not `--dir` or `--output-dir`.
It does not create parent directories or change the default download filename
when `--output` is omitted. Validation cannot prevent another local process
from replacing a path component between validation and I/O; choose a root
whose directories you control. Unset the variable to restore the CWD boundary.

### Pagination

| Flag                | Description                                    | Default |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `--page-all`        | Auto-paginate, one JSON line per page (NDJSON) | off     |
| `--page-limit <N>`  | Max pages to fetch                             | 10      |
| `--page-delay <MS>` | Delay between pages                            | 100 ms  |

### Google Sheets — Shell Escaping

Sheets ranges use `!` which bash interprets as history expansion. Always wrap values in **single quotes**:

```bash
# Read cells A1:C10 from "Sheet1"
gws sheets spreadsheets values get \
  --params '{"spreadsheetId": "SPREADSHEET_ID", "range": "Sheet1!A1:C10"}'

# Append rows
gws sheets spreadsheets values append \
  --params '{"spreadsheetId": "ID", "range": "Sheet1!A1", "valueInputOption": "USER_ENTERED"}' \
  --json '{"values": [["Name", "Score"], ["Alice", 95]]}'
```

### Helper Commands

Some services ship hand-crafted helper commands alongside the auto-generated Discovery surface. Helper commands are prefixed with `+` so they are visually distinct and never collide with Discovery-generated method names.

Time-aware helpers (`+agenda`, `+standup-report`, `+weekly-digest`, `+meeting-prep`) automatically use your **Google account timezone** (fetched from Calendar Settings API and cached for 24 hours). Override with `--timezone`/`--tz` on `+agenda`, or set the `--timezone` flag for explicit control.

Run `gws <service> --help` to see both Discovery methods and helper commands together.

```bash
gws gmail --help      # shows +send, +reply, +reply-all, +forward, +triage, +watch …
gws calendar --help   # shows +insert, +agenda …
gws drive --help      # shows +upload …
```

**Full helper reference:**

# Append a row to a spreadsheet
gws sheets +append --spreadsheet SPREADSHEET_ID --values "Alice,95"

# Show today's calendar agenda
gws calendar +agenda

# Upload a file to Drive
gws drive +upload ./report.pdf --name "Q1 Report"

# Morning standup summary
gws workflow +standup-report

# Show today's agenda in a specific timezone
gws calendar +agenda --today --timezone America/New_York
```

### Model Armor (Response Sanitization)

Integrate [Google Cloud Model Armor](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/model-armor) to scan API responses for prompt injection before they reach your agent.

```bash
gws gmail users messages get --params '...' \
  --sanitize "projects/P/locations/L/templates/T"
```

| Variable                                 | Description                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_SANITIZE_TEMPLATE` | Default Model Armor template |
| `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_SANITIZE_MODE`     | `warn` (default) or `block`  |

## Environment Variables

All variables are optional. See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for a copy-paste template.

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_TOKEN` | Pre-obtained OAuth2 access token (highest priority) |
| `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CREDENTIALS_FILE` | Path to OAuth credentials JSON (user or service account) |
| `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CLIENT_ID` | OAuth client ID (alternative to `client_secret.json`) |
| `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CLIENT_SECRET` | OAuth client secret (paired with `CLIENT_ID`) |
| `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CONFIG_DIR` | Override config directory (default: `~/.config/gws`) |
| `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_FILE_ROOT` | Existing directory allowed for `--output` / `--upload` paths (default: CWD); relative CLI paths remain CWD-relative |
| `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_SANITIZE_TEMPLATE` | Default Model Armor template |
| `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_SANITIZE_MODE` | `warn` (default) or `block` |
| `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_LOG` | Log level for stderr (e.g., `gws=debug`). Off by default. |
| `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_LOG_FILE` | Directory for JSON log files with daily rotation. Off by default. |
| `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_PROJECT_ID` | GCP project ID override for quota/billing and fallback for helper commands |

Environment variables can also be set in a `.env` file (loaded via [dotenvy](https://crates.io/crates/dotenvy)).

## Exit Codes

`gws` uses structured exit codes so scripts can branch on the failure type without parsing error output.

| Code | Meaning | Example cause |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `0` | Success | Command completed normally |
| `1` | API error | Google returned a 4xx/5xx response |
| `2` | Auth error | Credentials missing, expired, or invalid |
| `3` | Validation error | Bad arguments, unknown service, invalid flag |
| `4` | Discovery error | Could not fetch the API schema document |
| `5` | Internal error | Unexpected failure |

```bash
gws drive files list --params '{"fileId": "bad"}'
echo $?   # 1 — API error

gws unknown-service files list
echo $?   # 3 — validation error (unknown service)
```

## Architecture

`gws` uses a **two-phase parsing** strategy:

1. Read `argv[1]` to identify the service (e.g. `drive`)
2. Fetch the service's Discovery Document (cached 24 h)
3. Build a `clap::Command` tree from the document's resources and methods
4. Re-parse the remaining arguments
5. Authenticate, build the HTTP request, execute

All output — success, errors, download metadata — is structured JSON.

## Troubleshooting

### "Access blocked" or 403 during login

Your OAuth app is in **testing mode** and your account is not listed as a test user.

**Fix:** Open the [OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent) in your GCP project → **Test users** → **Add users** → enter your Google account email. Then retry `gws auth login`.

### "Google hasn't verified this app"

Expected when your app is in testing mode. Click **Advanced** → **Go to \<app name\> (unsafe)** to proceed. This is safe for personal use; verification is only required to publish the app to other users.

### Too many scopes / consent screen error

Unverified (testing mode) apps are limited to ~25 OAuth scopes. The `recommended` scope preset includes many scopes and will exceed this limit.

**Fix:** Select only the scopes you need:

```bash
gws auth login --scopes drive,gmail,calendar
```

### `gcloud` CLI not found

`gws auth setup` requires the `gcloud` CLI to automate project creation. You have three options:

1. [Install gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) and use `gcloud` directly.
2. Re-run `gws auth setup` which wraps `gcloud` calls.
3. Skip `gcloud` entirely — set up OAuth credentials manually in the [Cloud Console](#manual-oauth-setup-google-cloud-console)

### `redirect_uri_mismatch`

The OAuth client was not created as a **Desktop app** type. In the [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page, delete the existing client, create a new one with type **Desktop app**, and download the new JSON.

### API not enabled — `accessNotConfigured`

If a required Google API is not enabled for your GCP project, you will see a
403 error with reason `accessNotConfigured`:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 403,
    "message": "Gmail API has not been used in project 549352339482 ...",
    "reason": "accessNotConfigured",
    "enable_url": "https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/gmail.googleapis.com/overview?project=549352339482"
  }
}
```

`gws` also prints an actionable hint to **stderr**:

```
💡 API not enabled for your GCP project.
   Enable it at: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/gmail.googleapis.com/overview?project=549352339482
   After enabling, wait a few seconds and retry your command.
```

**Steps to fix:**

1. Click the `enable_url` link (or copy it from the `enable_url` JSON field).
2. In the GCP Console, click **Enable**.
3. Wait ~10 seconds, then retry your `gws` command.

> [!TIP]
> You can also run `gws auth setup` which walks you through enabling all required
> APIs for your project automatically.
